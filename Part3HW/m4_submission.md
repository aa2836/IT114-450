<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div><br></div><div>For the 1st implementation, I used Coin toss command (random heads or tails).<br>The Coin toss command generates a random result of either "heads" or "tails".<br>Firstly it checks the entered command to see if it is "flip" ,"toss",<br>or "coin". If the command matches any of these, the code proceeds to<br>generate the result. the code uses a random number generator. It creates an<br>instance of the generator and assigns it the name "rand". This generator produces<br>random outcomes either "true" or "false". When the Coin toss command is executed<br>the generator generates a random outcome. If the outcome is "true" it represents<br>"heads" and if it is "false" it represents "tails". a method called "getClientName"<br>is implemented to assign a name to the user. the assigned name is<br>"Bob". When the Coin toss command is executed the "getClientName" method is called,<br>retrieving the name "Bob". The command then generates a result string using this<br>name&nbsp; "Bob flipped a coin and got heads" or "Bob flipped a coin<br>and got tails".</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>For the 2nd implementation I used Simple number guesser where all clients can<br>attempt to guess while the game is active. First the code checks if<br>the received message is "start". If it is and the game is not<br>already active the code starts the game. It sets a hidden number sends<br>a message to all players indicating that the game has started and returns<br>true and if it is not then the code checks if the message<br>is "stop". If it is and the game is active the code stops<br>the game sends a message to all players saying that the game has<br>stopped and says guess will be treated as regular message. If the message<br>begins with "guess " the code checks if the game is active. If<br>it is then the code extracts the number from the message and checks<br>if it matches the hidden number. If the guess is correct the code<br>displays that the user guessed correctly. If the guess is incorrect the code<br>says that the user guessed incorrectly.If none of the conditions are met, the<br>code sends a message to all players stating that the game is not<br>active and the user's guess will not be considered. The checkGuess function does<br>a comparison between the user's guess and the hidden number. If the guess<br>is right, it displays that the user guessed correctly. If the guess is<br>wrong it says the user guessed incorrectly.The generateRandomNumber function creates a random number<br>between 1 and 10. The getClientName function provides the name of the user<br>in this case returns "Bob".</div><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>In this assignment I learned about flow control in java specifically how to<br>start a server and client on the local machine. I also learned how<br>to add multiple clients to the server and establish communication between them. This<br>involved understanding how to manage the flow of information and messages between the<br>clients and the server, enabling them to interact and exchange data effectively.<br></p><br></td></tr>
